This is an in-depth guide to the data inside the Mapbox Streets vector tile source to help with styling. For full examples of using Mapbox Streets vector tiles to create a map style, check out the default templates in [Mapbox Studio](/studio).


## Overview


<h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>

Mapbox Streets vector tiles are largely based on data from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org), a free & global source of geographic data built by volunteers. An understanding of the OSM data structure and tagging system is not neccessary to make use of Mapbox Streets vector tiles, though it's helpful to understand some of the details.

When you publicly use styles or software that use Mapbox Streets vector tiles, you must [display proper attribution](https://www.mapbox.com/help/attribution/).


<h3>Name fields</h3>

There are 7 different name fields for each of the label layers:

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name</strong></code></td><td>The name (or names) used locally for the place.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name_en</strong></code></td><td>English (if available)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name_es</strong></code></td><td>Spanish&#42; (if available)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name_fr</strong></code></td><td>French&#42; (if available)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name_de</strong></code></td><td>German&#42; (if available)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name_ru</strong></code></td><td>Russian (if available)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code><strong>name_zh</strong></code></td><td>Chinese&dagger; (if available)</td></tr>
</table>

&#42; For the Spanish, French, and German labels there are additional fallback conditions. Where the local name is in a non-latin writing system and no Spanish/French/German translation is available, these fields will show an English or international version of the name if possible, otherwise they will show the local name.

&dagger; The `name_zh` field contains Mandarin using simplified Chinese characters for our custom label layers: `#country_label`, `#state_label`, and `#marine_label`. All other label layers are sourced from OpenStreetMap and may contain one of several dialects and either simplified or traditional Chinese characters in the `name_zh` field.


<h3>Boolean fields</h3>

Some fields represent a boolean condition; the value may be either true or false. To keep the vector tiles compact these fields may be stored as integers, where `0` = false and `1` = true.


<h3>Multiple geometry types</h3>

Mapnik vector tiles support multiple geometry types in the same layer. The Mapbox Streets source takes advantage of this for some layers.

A geometry in the vector tile can be one of 3 types:

1. <span class='small inline icon marker'></span> Point
2. <span class='small inline icon polyline'></span> Linestring / multilinestring
3. <span class='small inline icon polygon'></span> Polygon / multipolygon


In Mapbox Studio, you can select just one or two or all of the 3 types with the Geometry Type toggles:

<img class='pady4' src='/img/developers/vector-tiles/filter-geomtype.png'>


<h3>Data updates</h3>

The current supported version of the Mapbox Streets vector tiles receives regular data updates as new information becomes available and existing information is improved.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Layer</th><th>Source</th><th>Update frequency</th></tr>
<tr><td>most layers</td><td>OpenStreetMap replication feed</td><td>every 5 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href='#admin'>#admin</a></td><td>custom OpenStreetMap processing</td><td>irregular schedule; every 2-6 months</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href='#water'>#water</a> (ocean parts)</td><td><a href='http://openstreetmapdata.com'>OpenStreetMap Data</a></td><td>irregular schedule; every 2-6 months</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href='#marine_label'>#marine_label</a>, <a href='#country_label'>#country_label</a>, <a href='#state_label'>#state_label</a></td><td>custom data</td><td>rarely, as needed</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>OSM IDs</h3>

OSM IDs are not stored as object properties but as object IDs within the vector tile. This means they are not available for styling via Mapbox Studio, but can still be interacted with via Mapbox GL JS and other vector tile libraries.

OpenStreetMap ID spaces are not unique across node, way, and relation object types. In order to make them unique for vector tiles, the IDs are transformed based on their OpenStreetMap object type and vector tile geometry type. IDs are multiplied by 10 and then increased by 0-4 depending on type.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>OSM type</th><th>Geometry type                  </th><th>OSM ID transform</th></tr>
<tr><td>node    </td><td>point                          </td><td><code>id × 10</code>       <em class='quiet'>eg. 123 → 1230</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>way     </td><td>line                           </td><td><code>(id × 10) + 1</code> <em class='quiet'>eg. 123 → 1231</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>way     </td><td>polygon + polygon label points </td><td><code>(id × 10) + 2</code> <em class='quiet'>eg. 123 → 1232</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>relation</td><td>line                           </td><td><code>(id × 10) + 3</code> <em class='quiet'>eg. 123 → 1233</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>relation</td><td>polygon + polygon label points </td><td><code>(id × 10) + 4</code> <em class='quiet'>eg. 123 → 1234</em></td></tr>
</table>

Much of the data in the vector tiles is merged or transformed such that OSM IDs are lost - such objects will have a __`osm_id`__ of `0`.

## Changelog

A summary of the changes from v6:

Mapbox Streets v7 contains 10 major changes that may require reworking of your styles depending on how they've been constructed:

1. The separate `#bridge` and `#tunnel` layers are gone and  have been merged into `#road`. A new `structure` class field describes whether the road segment is a `bridge`, `tunnel`, `ford`, or `none`. When upgrading from v6, bridge and tunnel style layers should be pointed at the `#road` layer with appropriate filters on the `structure` field. Bridges and tunnels are not distinct from roads until zoom level 13.
2. Major changes to the `class` fields have been made in the [#road](#road) layer:
    - The `main` class has been seperated into `trunk`, `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary` classes.
   - The `street` class has been modified to include `unclassified`, `residential`, `road` and `living_street`.
    - The `street_limited` class no longer includes pedestrian streets or roads under construction.
    - New classes:
      - `pedestrian` - includes pedestrian streets, plazas, and public transportation platforms
      - `construction` - includes motor roads under construction (but not service roads, paths, etc)
      - `track` - contains tracks that were part of the `service` class in v6
      - `ferry`
    - The following class names have been unchanged: `motorway`, `motorway_link`, `path`, `golf`, `major_rail`, and `minor_rail`.
    - Class names `main` and `driveway` have been removed.
    - Classes `construction`, `track`, `service`, `path`, `ferry` and `aerialway` pull in additional `type` detail when it is available from OpenStreetMap as outlined in [#road](#road) section.
7. Road labels: new road classes will also apply to their corresponding labels.
4. New possible combination of `shield=us-highway` with `reflen=4`. This may require a new sprite image. New networks added to the `road_label` layer's `shield` field. These will require new sprite images.
4. New layer [#mountain_peak_label](#mountain_peak_label) contains mountain peaks that were in the `poi_label` layer in v6. New fields `elevation_m` & `elevation_ft` contain the peak elevations in meters and feet, respectively. Values are rounded to the nearest integer. New values in the `maki` field: `mountain`, `volcano`.
5. New layer [#airport_label](#airport_label) contains airports that were in the `poi_label` layer in v6.
6. New layer [#rail_station_label](#rail_station_label) contains rail stations that were in the `#poi_label` layer in v6. Major changes have been made to `network` field values. New networks have been added and existing networks renamed for clarity. If you are using this field to style rail station icons you will need to rename existing sprite images and add new ones. See outlined below in [#rail_station_label](#rail_station_label).
7. National parks and similar parks are now in their own class `national_park` in the `landuse_overlay` layer, whereas in v6 they were part of the `park` class of the `landuse` layer.
9. New `type` values have been added to the `place_label` layer: `island` (moved from `poi_label`), `islet` (moved from `poi_label`), `archipelago`, `residential`, and `aboriginal_lands`.
10. OSM ID tranformation algorithm has changed (see previous section) and are stored as vector tile object IDs rather than standalone fields.


Additionally, v7 includes the following more specific/limited changes:

- Landuse: `class=aboriginal_lands` has been added here from `boundary=aboriginal_lands` and `boundary:type=aboriginal_lands` in OSM.
- POI labels: the `name` field of the `poi_label` layer may be null (in v6, nameless POIs were not included). Nameless POIs will have never have a `maki` value of `marker` (the generic default).
- POI labels: adjustments to existing maki values:
    - `grocery`: now includes marketplaces
    - `shop`: now includes camera and photo shops (`camera` value is removed)
- Gullies: the `class=cliff` features in the barrier_line layer now include `natural=earth_bank` (aka gully) objects from OSM.
- Road labels: 'Park' is no longer abbreviated to 'Pk'.
- Bridges and tunnels are not distinct from roads until zoom level 13.
- Underground buildings: the `building` layer includes a new `underground` field that is either `true` or `false` depending on whether the building is underground (eg a subway station)



## Layer Reference


<!-- LANDUSE -->
<a class='doc-section' id='landuse'></a>
<h3><a href='#landuse'>#landuse</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='polygons'>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon marker'></span>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon polyline'></span>
        <span class='      inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>4</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

This layer includes polygons representing both land-use and land-cover.

It's common for many different types of landuse/landcover to be overlapping, so the polygons in this layer are ordered by the area of their geometries to ensure smaller objects will not be obscured by larger ones. Pay attention to use of transparency when styling - the overlapping shapes can cause muddied or unexpected colors.

<h4>Classes</h4>

The main field used for styling the landuse layer is __`class`__.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'aboriginal_lands'</code></td><td>The boundary of aboriginal lands.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'agriculture'</code></td><td>Various types of crop and farmland</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'cemetery'</code></td><td>Cemeteries and graveyards</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'glacier'</code></td><td>Glaciers or permanent ice/snow</td></tr>

<!-- WATERWAY -->
<a class='doc-section' id='waterway'></a>
<h3><a href='#waterway'>#waterway</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='lines'>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon marker'></span>
        <span class='      inline small icon polyline'></span>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>4</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

The waterway layer contains classes for rivers, streams, canals, etc represented as lines. These classes can represent a wide variety of possible widths. It's best to have your line stying biased toward the smaller end of the scales since larger rivers and canals are usually also represented by polygons in the [#water](#water) layer. Also works best under `#water` layer.

<h4>Classes and types</h4>

The waterway layer has two fields for styling - __`class`__ and __`type`__ - each with similar values.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'river'</code></td><td>Everything from the Amazon down to small creeks a couple meters wide</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'canal'</code></td><td>Medium to large artificial waterway</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'stream'</code></td><td>Very small waterway, usually no wider than a meter or two</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'stream_intermittent'</code></td><td><strong>Class only</strong>. A stream that does not always have water flowing through it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'drain'</code></td><td>Medium to small artificial channel for rainwater drainage, often concrete lined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'ditch'</code></td><td>Small artificial channel dug in the ground for rainwater drainage.</td></tr>
</table>


<!-- WATER -->
<a class='doc-section' id='water'></a>
<h3><a href='#water'>#water</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='polygons'>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon marker'></span>

        <span class='      inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>8</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

This is a simple polygon layer with no differentiating types or classes. Water bodies are filtered and simplified according to scale - only oceans and very large lakes are shown at the lowest zoom levels, while smaller and smaller lakes and ponds appear as you zoom in.


<!-- AEROWAY -->
<a class='doc-section' id='aeroway'></a>
<h3><a href='#aeroway'>#aeroway</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='lines & polygons'>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon marker'></span>

        <span class='quiet inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>4</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

The aeroway layer includes both lines and polygons representing runways, helipads, etc.

<h4>Types</h4>

The __`type`__ field separates different types of aeroways for styling.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'runway'</td><td>Where planes take off & land</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'taxiway'</td><td>Where planes move between runways, gates, and hangars</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'apron'</td><td>Where planes park, refuel, load</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'helipad'</td><td>Where helicopters take off & land</td></tr>
</table>


<!-- BARRIER_LINE -->
<a class='doc-section' id='barrier_line'></a>
<h3><a href='#barrier_line'>#barrier_line</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='lines & polygons'>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon marker'></span>
        <span class='      inline small icon polyline'></span>
        <span class='      inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>4</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

This layer includes lines and polygons for barriers - things such as walls and fences.

<h4>Classes</h4>

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'cliff'</code></td><td>The precipice of a vertical or very steep drop, gullies are included</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'fence'</code></td><td>Include various types of fence and wall barriers</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'gate'</code></td><td>Only gates that are lines or areas are included</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'hedge'</code></td><td>A line of closely spaced shrubs and tree species, which form a barrier or mark the boundary of an area</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'land'</code></td><td>Includes breakwaters and piers</td></tr>
</table>

Cliff data from OSM is designed such that the left-hand side of the line is the top of the cliff, and the right-hand side is the bottom.


<!-- BUILDING -->
<a class='doc-section' id='building'></a>
<h3><a href='#building'>#building</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='polygons'>
        <span class='quiet inline small icon marker'></span>

        <span class='      inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>2</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

Large buildings appear at zoom level 13, and all buildings are included in zoom level 14 and up.

<h4>Underground buildings</h4>

The __`underground`__ field is usually `false`, but will be `true` for buildings that are underground (for example, some subway stations).


<!-- LANDUSE_OVERLAY -->
<a class='doc-section' id='landuse_overlay'></a>
<h3><a href='#landuse_overlay'>#landuse_overlay</a>
    <div class='geomtype' title='polygons'>

        <span class='      inline small icon polygon'></span>
        buffer: <strong>8</strong>
    </div>
</h3>

This layer is for landuse / landcover polygons that should be drawn above the [#water](#water) layer.

<h4>Classes</h4>

The main field used for styling the landuse_overlay layer is __`class`__.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'national_park'</code></td><td>Relatively large area of land set aside by a government for human recreation and enjoyment, animal and environmental protection</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'wetland'</code></td><td>Wetlands that may include vegetation (marsh, swamp, bog)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'wetland_noveg'</code></td><td>Wetlands that probably don't contain vegetation (mud, tidal flat)</td></tr>

The roads layers are some of the most complex ones in Mapbox Streets. Separate `bridge` and `tunnel` layers are gone and  have been merged into road. `structure` field describes whether the road segment is a `bridge`, `tunnel`, `ford`, or `none`. Bridges and tunnels are not distinct from roads until zoom level 13.

<h4>Classes</h4>

The main field used for styling the road layers is __`class`__.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'motorway'</code></td><td>High-speed, grade-separated highways</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'motorway_link'</code></td><td>Interchanges / on & off ramps</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>'aerialway'</code></td><td>Ski lifts, gondolas, and other types of aerialway.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'golf'</code></td><td>The approximate centerline of a golf course hole</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>One-way roads</h4>

The __`oneway`__ field will have a value of either `'true'` or `'false'` to indicate whether the motor traffic on the road is one-way or not. If the road is one-way, traffic travels in the same direction as the linestring.


<h4>Types</h4>

The __`type`__ field is the value of the road's "primary" OpenStreetMap tag. For most roads this is the `highway` tag, but for aerialways it will be the `aerialway` tag, and for golf holes it will be the `golf` tag. See <a href='http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/highway#values'>Taginfo</a> for a list of used tag values. Several classes pull in additional detail when it is available from OpenStreetMap.

Possible `construction` class `type` values:

<div class='col12 clearfix space-bottom2'>

For the `path` class, some custom type assignments have been made based on insight from various categorical, physical, and access tags from OpenStreetMap.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>

</h3>

Administrative boundary lines. These are constructed from the OSM data in such a way that there are no overlapping lines where multiple boundary areas meet.

<h4>Administrative level</h4>

The __`admin_level`__ field separates different levels of boundaries, using a similar numbering scheme to OpenStreetMap.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>2</code></td><td>Countries</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>3</code></td><td>Some subnational regions or groupings: regions of Papua New Guinea, The Philippines, Venezuela; governorates of Lebanon; federal districts of Russia; some disputed and semi-autonomous regions.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>4</code></td><td>Most first-level subnational boundaries (states, provinces, etc.)</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Disputes</h4>

The __`disputed`__ field should be used to apply a dashed or otherwise distinct style to disputed boundaries. No single map of the world will ever keep everybody happy, but acknowledging disputes where they exist is an important aspect of good cartography.

<h4>Maritime boundaries</h4>

The __`maritime`__ field can be used as a filter to downplay or hide maritime boundaries, which are often not shown on maps. Note that the practice of tagging maritime boundaries is not entirely consitent or complete within OSM, so some boundaries may not have this field set correctly (this mostly affects admin levels 3 & 4).

<h4>ISO 3166-1 Codes</h4>

The __`iso_3166_1`__ field contains the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166) code or codes that apply to a boundary. For subnational boundaries this will be a single code of the parent country. For international boundaries between two countries, the value will be the codes of both countries in alphabetical order, separated by a dash (`-`).

<h4>Names</h4>

See _Name fields_ in the [overview](#Overview) for information about names and translations.

<h4>Types</h4>

The main field for styling labels for different kinds of places is __`type`__.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>'city'</code></td><td>Settlement of about 100,000 or more people.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'town'</code></td><td>Urban or rural settlement of about 10,000-100,000 people</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'village'</code></td><td>Usually rural settlement of less than about 10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'hamlet'</code></td><td>Rural settlement with a population of about 200 or fewer</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'suburb'</code></td><td>A distinct section of an urban settlement such as an annexed town, historical district, or large & important neighborhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'neighbourhood'</code></td><td>A named part of a larger settlement</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>'islet'</code></td><td>A very small island.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'archipelago'</code></td><td>Collective name for a group of islands</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'residential'</code></td><td>Named residential areas, including subdivisions and apartment complexes</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'aboriginal_lands'</code></td><td>Reservations and other aboriginal lans</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Capitals</h4>

The __`capital`__ field allows distinct styling of labels or icons for the capitals of countries, regions, or states & provinces. The value of this field may be `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`. National capitals are `2`, and `3` through `6` represent capitals of various sub-national administrative entities. These levels come from OpenStreetMap and have different meanings in different countries - see [the OpenStreetMap wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level) for specific details.

<h4>Scalerank</h4>

The __`scalerank`__ field can be used to adjust the prominence of label styles for larger and more prominent cities. The value number from 0 through 9, where 0 is the large end of the scale (eg New York City). All places other than large cities will have a scalerank of `null`.

<h4>Localrank</h4>

The __`localrank`__ field can be used to adjust the label density by showing fewer labels. It is a whole number greater than 0 calculated by grouping places into a 128 pixel grid at each zoom level, then assigning each place a ranking within that grid. The most important place in that 128 pixels will get a __`localrank`__ of 1, the second most important is 2, and so on. Therefore to reduce the label density to 4 labels per tile, you can add the filter `[localrank=1]`.

<h4>Label direction</h4>

The __`ldir`__ field can be used as a hint for label offset directions at lower zoom levels. For places with a __`scalerank`__ value set, the __`ldir`__ will be a cardinal direction such as `'N'`, `'E'`, `'SW'`.

</h3>

This layer is used to place icons and labels for various points of interest (POIs).

<h4>Names</h4>

See _Name fields_ in the [overview](#Overview) for information about names and translations.

<h4>Maki icons</h4>

The __`maki`__ field is designed to make it easy to add icons to POIs using the [Maki icon project](http://mapbox.com/maki), or with other icons that follow the same naming scheme.


Not all Maki icons are used, and different types of related POIs will sometimes have the same __`maki`__ value (eg universities and colleges, or art supply shops and art galleries). Nameless POIs will have never have a maki value of marker (the generic default). The possible values for the __`maki`__ field are listed below.

<h4>Type</h4>

The __`type`__ field contains a more specific classification intended for display - eg 'Cafe', 'Hotel', 'Laundry'. These values come from the original OpenStreetMap tags and are not a limited set.

<h4>Scalerank</h4>

The __`scalerank`__ field is intended to help assign different label styles based on the prominence of different features.

<table class='small space-bottom2'>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>1</code></td><td>The POI has a very large area</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>2</code></td><td>The POI has a medium-large area</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>3</code></td><td>The POI has a small area, or is of a type that is commonly large and important (eg hospital, university)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>4</code></td><td>The POI has no known area</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>5</code></td><td>The POI has no name</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Controlling label density</h4>

The __`localrank`__ field can be used to adjust the label density by showing fewer labels. It is a whole number >=1 calculated by grouping places into a ~300m projected grid, then assigning each place a ranking within that grid. The most important place in each cell will get a __`localrank`__ of 1, the second most important is 2, and so on.

<h4>Names</h4>

See _Name fields_ in the [overview](#Overview) for information about names and translations.

<h4>Route numbers</h4>

In addition to the standard name fields, there is also a __`ref`__ field that holds any reference codes or route numbers a road may have. From zoom levels 6 through 10, all geometries are points and the only labels are highways shields. From zoom level 11 and up the geometries are all lines.

The __`shield`__ field indicates the style of shield needed for the route. Current possibilities are:

<h4>Network</h4>

The __`network`__ field lets you assign more specific icons for rail stations that are part of specific local or regional transit systems. They don't necessarily correspond to a specific network - eg `de-u-bahn` applies to any U-Bahn network in Germany since these can all use the same icon in a map style. Some stations serve multiple networks; in these cases, multiple network names are joined with a dot (in alphabetical order).

If none of the specific networks below apply to a station, the __`network`__ value will be the same as the __`maki`__ value (see previous section).

<h4>Elevations</h4>

The __`elevation_m`__ and __`elevation_ft`__ fields hold the peak elevation in meters and feet, respectively. Values are rounded to the nearest whole number and do not include units. Use a text field such as `{elevation_ft} feet` or `{elevation_m}m` in Mapbox Studio to display the units.

This layer contains points used to label the street number parts of specific addresses.

The __`house_num`__ field countains house and building numbers. These are commonly integers but may include letters or be only letters, eg "1600", "31B", "D". If an address has no number tag but has a house name or building name, the __`house_num`__ field will be the name instead.
